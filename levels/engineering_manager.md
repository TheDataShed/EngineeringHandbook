## What is an Engineering Manager?

Engineering Managers are engineers that have chosen to split there focus
between technical engineering and people management. They work together as a
team to support the engineering function, while continuing to contribute
technically to project work.

## What does an Engineering Manager do?

Our Engineering Managers are responsible for line management, personal
development, setting and monitoring objectives, and leadership in technical
delivery. They seek opportunities to innovate and promote best practice across
the engineering function.

### Within The Data Shed

Within the DataShed our Engineering Managers support the engineering function
and wider company in a number of unique ways:

- Ensure that appropriate information reaches the engineering function to allow
  Data Engineers to perform their roles and take appropriate action/give
  appropriate feedback to improve this.
- Support the Talent Acquisition Manager in assessing the relevance and quality
  of both incoming applications and potential candidates during the recruitment
  process.
- Assist in the development of The Data Shed's annual objectives, assuring that
  all Data Engineers are appropriately involved in how they will individually
  be contributing thereto.
- Regularly review the progress of engineers within the engineering function.
- Promote and practice a culture of continuous feedback.
- Seek to identify and address potential problems in project teams
- Continue to refine the role of Engineering Management within The Data Shed.

### Line Management

Our Engineering Managers have line management oversight for a number of Data
Engineers, with direct line management responsibility for a subset thereof.

- Assure that Data Engineers continue to be aware of required processes and
  adhere thereto.
- Assure that Data Engineers have the skills necessary to contribute in their
  roles by assisting with career development and training opportunities.
- Assure that Data Engineers continue to develop and make a wider contribution,
  both to The Data Shed and the wider community.
- Assure that Data Engineers maintain the Values of The Data Shed and that
  appropriate feedback — whether positive or constructive — is given in a
  timely fashion.
- Assure that the above are recorded and tracked as per The Data Shed's
  processes/frameworks.

### Career Development

Engineering managers are responsible both for the career development and growth
for those engineers they manage, and for ensuring wider resources are in place
for the development of the engineering function as a whole.

At an individual level this is:

- Assist in developing and setting engineers objectives, and ensure they
  aligned with the company objectives.
- Help identify and put in place the relevant training for engineers.

Across the engineering function:

- Maintain an awareness of the management/training frameworks within The Data
  Shed and contribute to and develop them.
- Provide mentoring and coaching to engineers.

### Technical Engineering

Our Engineering Managers continue to contribute to the technical progress of
projects within the DataShed. As with other engineers they will code and do
code reviews, along with continuing to develop and specialise their technical
skills.

They also work across projects in the following ways:

- Advance and promote engineering standards, process and practices across
  projects.
- Support the Tech Leads needs across projects.
- Provide early life technical support for new projects by working closely
  with the consultancy.
- Champion innovation, new technologies, platforms and solutions
