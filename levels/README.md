# Engineering Levels & Roles

Levels and Roles within Engineering are a means by which The Data Shed can
define a Data Engineer's primary function within Engineering, both internally
and to set client expectations.

## Levels

Engineering levels at The Data Shed are a combination of experience,
demonstrable ability and embodiment of The Data Shed's Values:

|Engineering Level|SFIA Level|
|----|----------|
|[Associate Data Engineer](associate_data_engineer.md)|[Level 2](sfia/sfia_associate_data_engineer.md)|
|[Technical Operations Engineer](technical_operation_engineer.md)|[Level 2](sfia/sfia_technical_operations_engineer.md)|
|[Data Engineer](data_engineer.md)|[Level 3](sfia/sfia_data_engineer.md)|
|[Senior Data Engineer](senior_data_engineer.md)|[Level 4](sfia/sfia_senior_data_engineer.md)|
|[Principal Data Engineer](principal_data_engineer.md)|[Level 5](sfia/sfia_principal_data_engineer.md)|

## Progression

We define three different tracks within engineering function.

- Management Track - For positions with people management responsibly
- Engineering Track - This covers the majority of technical positions within
the engineering function
- Operations Track - Covers positions within the support and operations team

Progression between the positions is represented below.

## Roles

Engineering roles are specific functions that individuals at a certain level
may perform in addition to their basic duties:

|Engineering Role|SFIA Level(s)|
|----|----------|
|[Tech Lead](roles/tech_lead.md)|[Level 4](sfia/sfia_tech_lead.md)|
