# Data Engineer

Our Data Engineers design, build, secure and monitor data pipelines, workflows,
automation, governance and the infrastructure that enables all the
aforementioned.

## What is a Data Engineer?

Data Engineering at The Data Shed is that aspect of our work which focuses on
the practical matters of the collection, analysis and insight of data. While
the aim of The Data Shed is indeed *"to empower organisations to spark and
embrace their own data evolution"*, our Data Engineers focus on the
provenance, collection and validation of those dataâ€”the application of
engineering principles to the systems which underpin our clients' operations.

## What does a Data Engineer do?

Practically, our Data Engineers are hands-on, information-processing experts.
They focus on the automation and optimisation of our clients' operations and
the tools and services necessary to achieve this (the development, verification
and enhancement thereof.)
