# SFIA within Engineering

The [SFIA framework](https://sfia-online.org/en/sfia-8) is a common language in
which to express the requirements and expectations for Engineers at all levels
at The Data Shed.

Our aim is to both provide clear guidance as to the areas in which we expect our
Engineers to be capable but also provide a structure flexible to accommodate
the variable needs and expectations of our Engineers' career paths.

## Progression

The below is intended to represent the approximate development of an Engineer
at The Data Shed:

|               |                      |                      |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
|               | Core (Shedder)       |                      |
|               | Core (Engineering)   |                      |
| Data Maturity |                      | Engineering Maturity |
|               | Technical Leadership |                      |

1. Firstly, there are a set of core competencies expected of *all* Shedders,
   regardless of which function in which they operate.
2. Next, there are a set of skills which form the basis of *all* our Engineers'
   abilities, regardless of their level.
3. Progressing further, there are potentially divergent paths and skill sets
   which and Engineer may pursue (named "Data-" and "Engineering-" maturity,
   above.)
4. Finally, there are some expectations when Engineers progress into a
   Technical Leadership.

As Engineers progress, the expected SFIA levels progress accordingly.

### Core (Shedder)

While progression and specific roles may place further requirements on
expected levels, the below constitutes the minimum requirements for all
working at The Data Shed:

Summary as follows:

|Skill|Code|Level|
|-----|----|-----|
|[Business administration](#business-administration)|ADMN|3|
|[Methods and tools](#methods-and-tools)|METL|3|
|[Content authoring](#content-authoring)|INCA|3|

#### Business administration

- Provides administrative support function to teams and meetings.
- Takes an active part in team meetings.
- Sets up files, software systems, onboarding new starters, compiles and
distributes reports. Provides guidance on administration software, procedures,
processes, tools and techniques.

#### Methods and tools

- Provides support on the use of existing methods and tools.
- Configures methods and tools within a known context.
- Creates and updates the documentation of methods and tools.

#### Content authoring

- Produces information artefacts that are accurate, current, relevant and easily
understood by the intended audience.
- Clarifies detailed content requirements with clients and representatives of the
intended audience.
- Designs, creates, controls and evaluates moderately complex subject matter.
- Makes informed decisions about the best way to present information to an
audience. Applies moderation and editing processes to content supplied by
others.
