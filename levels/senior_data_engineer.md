# Senior Data Engineer

Our Senior Data Engineers are a continuation of our
[Data Engineer](data_engineer.md) role but with a broader scope. While a Data
Engineer will focus on the data and systems which facilitate our clients'
operations, a Senior Data Engineer's scope—while still encompassing that of the
previous role—extends to both the Engineers with whom they work but also the
function of Engineering within The Data Shed itself.

## What is a Senior Data Engineer?

There are two main aspects which distinguish a Senior Data Engineer:

- an increased Data and Engineering maturity: our Engineers will always continue
  to grow and develop and our Senior Data Engineers demonstrate both a continual
  development of those skills demonstrated as a Data Engineer but also an
  increased breadth into further aspects of Data Engineering;
- increased operational maturity within Engineering at The Data Shed: Senior
  Data Engineers are asked to take a more direct role in developing their
  fellows as well as greater responsibility within client projects.

## What does a Senior Data Engineer do?

While our [Data Engineers](data_engineer.md) primary focus is the _"automation
and optimisation of our clients' operations"_, our Senior Data Engineers take
this further by taking that same approach to Engineering itself. With increased
authority and autonomy both on clients' projects and in the professional
development of their fellows, Senior Data Engineers can contribute not only to
the work we do but also the way in which we work as Engineers.
