# Java

## Formatting

We should aim for consistency and predictability across our Java code.

### Google Java Style

Java code should be formatted using
[`the Google Java Style Guide`](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html),
using the latest stable version.
[`Spotless`](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) can be a useful tool for
this.
