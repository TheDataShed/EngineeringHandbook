# End user devices - Supported operating systems

- Release date: 08/10/2021
- Review date: 08/11/2022
- Author: Edward Hiley
- Version: 1.0.1

## What is this policy?

This policy covers the use of operating systems used by end-user devices that
are supplied by and to be used by The Data Shed members of staff, or contractors
working at The Data Shed.

The policy applies to any end-user device supplied by The Data Shed or virtual
machine running on The Data Shed hosting being used for
busines-as-usual/interactive activities. End user devices includes, and is not
limited to, laptops, desktops, tablets and mobile phones (see
[Exclusions](#exclusions)).

Keeping to this policy is especially important to ensure that our laptops are
secure, supportable and consistent. This means there is more time to focus on
solving business problems, not operating system problems. It is also critical
for achieving
[Cyber Essentials Plus](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/cyberessentials/overview), which
gives confidence to customers that The Data Shed are working to protect from
cyber attacks, and is required for certain contracts.

## Exclusions

The policy does not apply where:

1. Clients have provided an end-user device for working on a particular project.
   Client supplied and/or owned devices remain the concern of the client, and
   any policies that the client may have in place need to be observed.
1. End-user devices have been provided by The Data Shed for a single project
   with specific requirements that conflict with this policy. The policy for
   these devices will be agreed separately.
1. End-user devices have not been supplied by The Data Shed (Bring Your Own
   Device - BYOD).
1. Operating systems are being used non-interactively as part of a running
   service, ephemeral or otherwise, being used as part of development[^1].

[^1]:
    It is expected that serverless or managed SaaS services are used where
    possible to avoid the proliferation of 'pets' - or in other words, more
    things The Data Shed needs to secure and keep up to date.

## Existing non compliant devices

There will be some pre-existing devices that do not meet this policy - such as
those running linux desktops. There are considered out of support, either:

1. Arrange for Support to prepare a new supported build to work with to minimise
   disruption and return the previous device, or.
1. Wait for a normal device refresh to take place and move to a supported
   version then.

Either option should take place within 6 months.
