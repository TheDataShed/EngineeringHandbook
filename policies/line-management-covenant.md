# LM covenant 
## Logistics
- Under current COVID regulations (13/12/21) all meetings will be held virtually via teams.
- 1-2-1s will be usually be scheduled fortnightly (probationary period or personal preference may mean this is more or less often).  1-2-1s will be scheduled no less frequently than monthly. 1-2-1s should usually last between 30 minutes and 1 hour.
- You are responsible for scheduling 1-2-1s. 1-2-1s should be scheduled to occur on a regular basis. 

## Cancellations
- As much notice should be given if one of us needs to cancel a scheduled meeting. Where possible we will give at least 48 hours notice but it is accepted that there will be occasions where short notice cancellations are unavoidable. 
- Any cancellations should be avoided whenever possible but whoever is responsible for said calculation is responsible for rescheduling the 1-2-1 (if necessary).
## Notes
- You are will keep your own notes and actions from any scheduled meetings. 
- You will complete the post 1-2-1 form within 48 hours of any scheuled 1-2-1 and include any actions for follow up.
