# Engineering Roles

We define roles within the DataShed because...

## The Roles

## How Are Roles Defined

Roles are defined using the SFIA framework and DataShed values. We then present an overview here.

### Responsibilities

Talk about the responsibilities...

### Values

How our DataShed values help define our roles. Link to the DataShed values PDF.

### SFIA Level

How we use SFIA to help define the key abilities and responsibilities of the engineering roles.

## Beyond the Role

What happens if you are exceeding your role?
