## Welcome

Welcome to the Shedronomicon. In these cursed pages you may find everything you
need for your journey as a Data Shed employee. If the passage does not yet
exist, have it inscribedâ€¦

## Contributing

The Shedronomicon is written in Markdown. If contributing, please keep to
Markdown, and roughly the same layout and format as existing pages. This helps
keep the handbook consistent throughout. Any new page should be added to the
contents below.

To run pre-commit markdownlint use the following command:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

You can find more info on pre-commit hooks
