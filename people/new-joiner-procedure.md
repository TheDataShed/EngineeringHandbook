# New Joiner Procedure

The new joiner procedure can be largely broken down into two phases:

| Phase      | Notes                                                                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Onboarding | Activities that occur before employment starts. Designed to begin engaging and motivating the new employee.  |
| Induction  | Usually the first day and involves introducing the employee to company process/ways of working and the team. |

#### Line Managers First Chat

The first chat should aim to cover the following:

- Mavenlink and its role in recording time for billing clients. Explain the
  categories and what they should be logging time.
  - Until billable, all time should be billed to "onboarding".
- Staff², covering:
  - Booking leave
  - Reporting sickness (including commination with line-managers)
  - How 1-2-1s are run, logged and where forms are posted afterwards
  - Objectives and how they are recorded in Staff²
- Shed Values™: what these are and that they will form part of the probation
  period.
- Introduction to company objectives.
- Introduction to project they will be joining (if not academy)

#### Booking New Starter 1-2-1's

1-2-1's should be arranged weekly for a duration depending on the new-starter's
level:

- Associate Data Engineer (SFIA 2): for their entire probation period;
- Data Engineer (SFIA 3): for the first 3 months;
- Senior Data Engineer (SFIA 4): for the first 6 weeks;
- Principal Data Engineer (SFIA 5): for the first 2 weeks.

Reducing to fortnightly thereafter.

#### Billing

The new-starter needs to be "billable" on project by:

- Associate (SFIA 2): 12 weeks;
- Data Engineer (SFIA 3): 6 weeks;
- Senior Data Engineer (SFIA 4): 2 weeks;
- Principal Data Engineer (SFIA 5): 1 week.

### First 1-2-1

The initial 1-2-1 should be used as time to get to know each other better and
how the manager can support the new engineer. A good method for running the
first 1-2-1 is contracting.

### Subsequent 1-2-1's

There are a number of important tasks to be completed over the next couple of
1-2-1's:

| Tasks                                              | When              |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Set any objectives for probation period            | Ideally 2nd 1-2-1 |
| Fill in the Onboarding and Induction Feedback form | Ideally 2nd 1-2-1 |
| Communicate timeline for being billable            | Ideally 2nd 1-2-1 |
| Record Shed Values scores                          | 2nd or 3rd 1-2-1  |
| Record skills in the skills matrix                 | 2nd or 2rd 1-2-1  |

Any objectives set should should be the recording in Staff² as probation
objectives.
