# Line Management Covenant

## Logistics

- Under current COVID regulations (13/12/21) all meetings will be held virtually
  via teams.
- 1-2-1s will be usually be scheduled fortnightly (probationary period or
  personal preference may mean this is more or less often. Details can be found
  in the [New Joiners Guidance](/guides/new-joiner)).
- 1-2-1s will be scheduled no less frequently than monthly.
- 1-2-1s should usually last between 30 minutes and 1 hour.
- You are responsible for scheduling 1-2-1s. They should be scheduled to occur
  on a regular basis.

## Cancellations

- As much notice should be given if one of us needs to cancel a scheduled
  meeting. Where possible we will give at least 48 hours notice but it is
accepted that there will be occasions where short notice cancellations are
unavoidable.
- If one of us has to cancel a scheduled meeting, that person is responsible for
 rescheduling the meeting (if necessary).
  
## Notes

- You will keep your own notes and actions from any scheduled meetings.
- You will complete the
[1-2-1 form](https://thedatashed.sharepoint.com/sites/sds/SitePages/1-to-1%27s-and-Objectives.aspx)
at least 24 hours prior to any scheduled
1-2-1 and e-mail it to me.
- You will complete the post 1-2-1 form within 48 hours of any scheuled 1-2-1
  and include any actions for follow up and e-mail it to me.
