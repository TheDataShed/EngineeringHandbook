# Engineer Interview Preparatory Explanation

## Technical Assessment

### Prerequisites

Before the interview there should be an initial contact wherein we should aim
to:

- contact the candidate on a video call using Teams;
- demonstrate GitPod to the candidate.

This will allow us to avoid any initial setup issues with Teams and provide at
least a passing familiarity with the format of the technical assessment.

## Explanatory Notes

The below must be shared with the candidate prior to the interview
itself:

- the technical assessment will take place using
  [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/), a web-based IDE similar in appearance and
  functionality to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If
  they are familiar with GitHub's
  [github.dev web-based editor](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/the-githubdev-web-based-editor)
  then this is very similar.
- the GitPod environment will be configured to run a series of tests,
  implemented in a language agreed with the candidate.
- the tests will initially be failing and the aim of the assessment is to
  add or update the existing code such that the tests pass.
