# The Shedronomicon Style Guide

This style guide indicates the basic rules of writing content for the
Shedronomicon. We aim to ensure consistency across our content and by doing so,
attempt to avoid confusion or misunderstanding.

## Nouns

Capitalise proper nouns throughout. For instance:

- "engineering", when referring to the discipline, SHOULD be lower-case (unless
  other grammatical rules apply).
- "Engineering", when referring to the department within The Data Shed, MUST be
  capitalised.

The exception is when referring to a specific command, which MUST be displayed
in a fixed-width font, for instance:

- when referring to the language, it MUST be written as _Python_.
- when referring to the command, it MUST be written as `python`.
- the language, however, is never simply _python_.

## Acronyms

Acronyms[^2] MUST be written in upper-case, for example:

- it's _ID_, not _id_[^1].
- it's _HTTP_, not _http_.

Where possible, the [acronyms](../acronyms.md) page SHOULD be updated with any
lesser-known[^3] references.

## Footnotes

[^1]: unless you're Freud.
[^2]: we're not getting into the acronyms vs. initialisms debate.
[^3]: _WWW_ and _HTTP_ are in common parlance; _TCP_ possibly less so.
