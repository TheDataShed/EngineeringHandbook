# Python at The Data Shed

Python is becoming more ubiquitous across The Data Shed engineering space, often
 the first choice of language for a new project.

The purpose of this page is to outline some best practices for Python development
 across t'Shed in order to facilitate standardisation and whatnot.

We should push these standards where we own the project.

For non-Shed-owned projects we should aim to follow existing standards set out ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Version

### Python 3

The default version you should use is the latest currently supported across all
 3 major cloud providers (Azure, AWS, GCP.) At the time of writing, this is **3.8**.

If your project does not currently use this version then you need to schedule a
 work item to upgrade. The version should be maintained as per the above and this
 should be accommodated in every project roadmap.

#### Python 2

**Never 2.\***. Shedders don't let Shedders use Python 2.

## Install

While Python is pre-installed or easily available in many operating systems, we
 recommend: [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).

**Note**: it should be installed using the [`pyenv-installer`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer)
 tool.

See the `pyenv` [documentation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#choosing-the-python-version)
 on managing multiple Python versions for different projects.

### Virtual Environments

For managing virtual environments using `pyenv`, use the [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)
 plugin. **Note**: this is installed by default when using the above `pyenv-installer`
 tool.

See the `pyenv-virtualenv` [documentation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv#activate-virtualenv)
 on managing multiple virtual environments for different projects.

## Formatting

We should aim for consistency and predictability across our Python code.

### Code Style

Python code should be formatted using [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/),
 specifically the latest tagged release (even if this is tagged as a beta.)

#### Existing Projects

When introducing `black` to a new project (or upgrading to a more recent version),
 make any formatting changes in an isolated merge-/pull-request. Don't confuse
 formatting with changes in logic.

### Imports

Imports should be ordered as per [`isort`](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) (see
 also the [`black` compatibility guide](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/docs/configuration/black_compatibility.html).)

### Docstrings

[Sphinx](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)
 style docstrings should be used throughout.

## Static Analysis

[`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) is a tool for identifying common
 security issues in Python and should be adopted into all relevant assurance pipelines.

## Dependency Checking

[`safety`](https://pyup.io/safety/) will check whether a Python project's
 dependencies have any known vulnerabilities.

**Note**: the free version of `safety` is only updated monthly and as such carries
 some risk. Alternative suggestions are encouraged.

## Testing

[`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/) should be used for all new projects.

Existing projects should plan to migrate to `pytest` though this can be facilitated
 by [running any existing `unittest` tests with `pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/unittest.html).
 All new tests, however, should use `pytest`.

### Coverage

- [`coverage`](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy) is suitable for new projects,
 enforcing the required degree of test coverage for all code.
  - `--show-missing` should be included for reporting on lines lacking coverage.
- [`diff_cover`](https://github.com/Bachmann1234/diff_cover)  is suitable for
 either new or existing projects, enforcing the required degree of test coverage
 for *only those lines changed*.

## `gitignore`

[`.gitignore`](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/windows,linux,macos,vim,emacs,sublimetext,intellij,pycharm,visualstudiocode,python)
 file as provided by [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io/).

The above should be used and any updates reflected in the template for all to use.

Although [GitHub](https://github.com/github/gitignore) provides similar templates,
 they are more specific, missing many of the ancillary files added by OSs, IDEs,
  etc.

## Requirements

[`pip`](https://github.com/pypa/pip), making sure to update regularly to the latest
 version.

Specifically, use the `python3 -m pip` variant for calling the `pip` module directly.

## Other Asides

Some of the following fall outside the scope of this document but are included
 until such time as similar documents exist to replace these next headings.

Others, such as the use of type hints in Python code, are currently only
 recommendations, though this may change as tooling gains more adoption.

### README

All projects must include a README which is formatted as per the [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)
 specification and validated using [`markdownlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)
  (or [`markdownlint-cli`](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli)).

### `pre-commit`

[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) is a framework for managing pre-commit
 hooks in variety of languages, including pre-configured hooks for many of the
 above tools. Its use is *highly* encouraged.

### Type Hints

Use of type hints using Python's [`typing`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
 module is *highly* encouraged.

## Integrated Desktop Environments (IDEs)

Common IDEs include:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  - see also the [PyLance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance))
   plugin.
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
