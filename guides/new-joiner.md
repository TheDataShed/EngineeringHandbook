# New Joiner Procedure

## On acceptance/Signed-contract

- send out the curriculum for Shed Academy[^1].
  - for anyone attending the Academy or as Engineers, this is an opportunity
    for us to make clear our expectations and for the latter group, a chance
    to perhaps identify any areas for future improvement.
- grant access to
  [EngineeringHandbook](https://github.com/TheDataShed/EngineeringHandbook) via
  GitHub[^1].
- agree and organise a "Shuddy"[^2]:
  - for SFIA 2/3, this should be closer to a technical "mentor".
  - for SFIA 4+, this should be a cross-function Shedder (i.e. from Delivery,
    Consultancy, etc.)

## Thursday prior to their start

- email/itinerary sent to new-joiner[^2]:
  - existing process continues as-is.
  - add line suggesting an informal call with their future line-manager (see
    below.)

## Friday prior to their start

- informal chat with line-manager, if agreed as per the above[^2].
  - nothing more than an introduction and to answer any questions with regard
    to the itinerary.

## First day

- structured first-chat with line-manager[^2]:
  - Mavenlink: use of and to what category they should be logging time:
    - can we streamline this further? Pre-allocate everything to "onboarding"
      for the expected period to reduce the amount of onboarding necessary?
  - Staff², covering:
    - booking leave;
    - reporting sickness (including comms. with line-managers);
    - how 1-2-1s are run, logged and where forms are posted afterwards;
    - objectives and how they are recorded in Staff².
  - Shed Values™:
    - what these are and that they will form part of the probation period.
- have a clearly-defined timeline for "onboarding"[^2].
  - when do they stop booking time to "onboarding"? Likely to be project-based
    but this should be agreed beforehand.
- update the Shed 101 Trello board:
  - remove project-specific onboarding from the board;
    - projects should remain only insofar as they are an introduction to the
      project relevant to *all* Shedders.
    - projects should maintain their own onboarding documentation.
- book meeting with project leads and—if line-management is expected to
  change—their future line-manager for end-of-probation.
- introduce "Shuddy" concept:
  - Shuddy should arrange a meeting with them later this day.

## 1-2-1s

- these should be arranged weekly for a duration depending on the new-starter's
  level[^1]:
  - Associate (SFIA 2): for their entire probation period;
  - Data Engineer (SFIA 3): for the first 3 months;
  - Senior Data Engineer (SFIA 4): for the first 6 weeks;
  - Principal Data Engineer (SFIA 5): for the first 2 weeks.
- reducing to fortnightly thereafter.

### First 1-2-1

The output of this meeting should be the recording in Staff² of probation
objectives[^1]:

- the new-starter needs to be "billable" on project by:
  - Associate (SFIA 2): 12 weeks;
  - Data Engineer (SFIA 3): 6 weeks;
  - Senior Data Engineer (SFIA 4): 2 weeks;
  - Principal Data Engineer (SFIA 5): 1 week.
- the new-starter must give formal(ish) feedback on onboarding process:
  - create a standardised form on Sharepoint for collecting this.
- the new-starter must record their Shed Values™ scores;
- the new-starter must complete the Skill Matrix (when it's ready.)

## End of probation

- the meeting for this already be booked (as per *First day*)[^1]:
  - formal letter to be sent out;
  - what can we do to better recognise this?
- this should be first meeting with new line-manager
  - next 1-2-1 to be lead by new line-manager (with Engineering Manager in
    attendance);
    - Objectives to be raised and discussed in line with company objectives;
  - next 1-2-1 Engineering Manager to attend only
    - Objectives to be finalised (and recorded in Staff²).

[^1]: new thing for Engineering.
[^2]: new thing for all Shedders.
